# Budget Tracker

A budget tracking app built with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

This is a remake of a previous app I made with [React](https://github.com/fa-901/budget-tracker).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
